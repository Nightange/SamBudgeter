# SamBudgeter
This is a simple little budgeter I(Sam) coded using python

WHAT IT DOES:
As mentioned before, this is a simple budgeter. It uses user input to create a user object depending on the kind of worker they are(wage, salary, contract). Following the user input, the user can do numerous different things(calculate income, savings, expenses, leftover income, and displaying previous information) for three time periods: weekly, monthly, yearly. This is a good way to easily see how much money you should save, and how much you can have leftover to spend. 

WHY:
I made this code to help me budget, since doing all those calculations can be tricky and there could be lots of room for human error. Since I had this issue, I'm sure others did too, leading me to make it a more diverse program than it would have been otherwise. 

DIFFICULTIES WHILE CODING:
Most of the issues I came across was having to relearn python from not using it for a while. On top of relearning python, I had to make an effort to go beyond what I learned before, learning new things like dispatchers and ways to compress my code to make it easier to read. 

HOW TO RUN IT:
You can run it by running the 'main.py' file in an IDE or something of the like. 

POTENTIAL CHANGES:
In the future, storing user information locally so it doesn't leave when the program stops would be a significant addition I would like to make. Other than that, I would like to add more variety within the objects, to help account for more job types instead of narrowing everybody down to just the three. Another addition would be to expand the things users can do, like saving for a specific thing, or having different things they put their money into(savings, expenses, as well as maybe stocks/investments), though that could be tricky using the weekly/monthly/yearly timeframes.
